### Understanding, implementing, documenting and playing with ASCON cipher, the state of the art of Lightweight Cryptography (LWC).<br><br>

### What is ASCON?
* ####  Ascon is a lightweight cryptographic family that includes Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), Hashing, and Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms.
* #### It has been selected as the primary choice for lightweight authenticated encryption in the final portfolio of the CAESAR competition (2014â€“2019).
* #### It has been selected by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for future standardization of the lightweight cryptography (Feb, 2023).<br><br>

### Some features I like about ASCON
* #### It processes data like a sponge (absorbing/squeezing), hence its name is Ascon (lookup the ascon canal system). 
* #### One-pass and inverse free.
* #### No need for key scheduling.
* #### No need for using lookup tables for Sbox in the implementation.<br><br>
